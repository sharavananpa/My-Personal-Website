                <p>
                    I was part of Fidelity's Workplace Investing business unit. I worked primarily on building the
                    backend (using <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">Spring Boot</a>) of a middleware (ETL) application in the <a
                        href="https://www.fidelityworkplace.com/s/401ksmallbusiness-pep" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">PEP</a> domain. The application would receive a webhook via the
                    exposed APIs from third-party <a
                        href="https://www.fidelityworkplace.com/s/401ksmallbusiness-payroll" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">Payroll Vendors</a> when they process payroll for the participants. We
                    then pull some data from the vendor's exposed APIs and process them. Finally, we send the processed
                    data to a downstream system, which eventually reaches the mainframe server. I got to work on a few
                    DevOps automation where I had to build CI/CD pipelines for the application and minimal frontend
                    stuff using <a href="https://angular.dev/overview" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">Angular</a> since we started this project from scratch. Besides, I
                    worked on a few BU-level projects to enhance the development experience. One important project was
                    to build a search engine that would look through the <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Service Now</a>, <a

                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> data and return results of the projects,
                    tech stacks used, product owner, lead developer, etc. The idea was to help people (in this huge
                    organization) find similar projects, technologies or whatever they are looking for, get some
                    assistance and even find platforms on which they can onboard. We used <a
                        href="https://angular.dev/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angular</a> for
                    the front end and <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">Python</a> with <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flask</a> for the back end. Sadly, I left the
                    organization before we could complete it.

                    It is

                    technologies required to be a Full Stack Engineer. We primarily learnt
                    <a href="https://angular.dev/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angular</a> and

                    along with some soft skills. The capstone project was to build a trading platform with
                    authentication and external APIs. Other than
                    that, I collaborated with my previous manager's team to build a

                    This internship was during the final semester of college. It was tough to manage both our college
                    project and the internship. But I somehow got through it (like any other situation in life). I was a
                    part of the core team that maintained an application platform called
                    <a href="https://www.adeptia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adeptia</a>.
                    The application was
                    going through a significant upgrade. They had recently moved from a monolith architecture to a
                    microservices architecture. I worked on testing the newer version to see if the application was
                    scaling well, to see if the performance was adequate and to find other bugs. These bugs had to be
                    reported to the vendor (Adeptia was a third-party vendor application). It was a pretty slow and
                    time-consuming process. I then worked on building a Work Intake Tool. This tool would collect
                    appropriate data from potential "tenants" of the platform (and assign a score) to see if their use
                    case would fit. We used a survey tool called

                    This internship was during my third year in college. It was a 2-month internship that happened
                    during the summer break. I was part of an Enterprise Data Lake team, which primarily used
                    <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Snowflake</a>
                    as their data warehouse (Fidelity was amid a major migration from Mainframe to Cloud). I worked on a
                    test automation framework using
                    <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python</a>,
                    <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference-commands" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">SQL</a>
                    and

                    for an ETL process. This framework helped
                    reduce the testing time significantly. I got exposed to the agile framework here and also gained a
                    fair understanding of how a finance firm's back office operates.

                    After working for almost two years, I quit my job to learn music for a year. My mind is a mess. It
                    is extremely difficult for me to make decisions. I think, think and keep thinking indefinitely. It
                    was a tough decision to quit my job. I've decided to try out music, make friends in the field and
                    see if this is a good fit for me. I've come down to computer science and music as the two ultimate
                    paths that I'd take in my life. One will make me money, and the other will stay a hobby! That said,
                    this conservatory is one of the best in the country. Though it doesn't compare very well in the
                    international arena, I think this place is a good start for me. I've got some of the best teachers
                    in the country. My <a href="https://www.rt.com/india/583069-ar-rahman-russian-piano-studio/"

                    I decided to join this course at the very last moment. There was a bit of hesitation since the
                    course was a bit expensive. I figured my not going to work was already costly and would not make
                    much difference monetarily. There is a hard cap of one year for my musical endeavours, and I would
                    start looking for jobs after that. So, I decided to make the most of the year and see how things
                    unfold. I already had a bit of knowledge about mixing and production before joining. The goal is to
                    consolidate all that knowledge and fill in the gaps. The instructor here is from the industry and is
                    a phenomenal teacher.

                    I got my engineering degree from this institution. It is a tier-1 college at the state level and
                    probably at the bottom of the tier-1 list at the national level. Since I didn't have enough marks,
                    we had to pay a capitation fee to get a seat. I learned a lot here - not just the subjects, but much
                    more. I made a lot of friends, and we travelled a lot. Even though we spent almost half of the time
                    at home due to COVID-19, I have no regrets. We travelled and partied so much in the first one and a
                    half years that I don't feel like I missed out! That said, my concentration on my studies didn't
                    deteriorate because of all the fun. I got good grades. In hindsight, I think COVID might have
                    affected my education a bit. I feel I might not have absorbed as much as I'd liked. But we had no
                    control over it anyway!
                    The projects that we worked on were quite interesting. All of them were using Machine Learning. We
                    worked for our professor (and class tutor) on her PhD project. We devised feature ranking algorithms
                    for high-dimensional datasets that are used for training machine learning models. We worked on
                    improving the efficiency of Malware Detectors using Neural Networks (RNN, LSTM, Transformer, et
                    cetera). We read research papers all night without understanding a single line of math. ChatGPT
                    wasn't even a thing back then, and it is funny now to think that we worked on something similar.

                    This is the only school that I've ever studied in. I spent my 14 years of childhood here. It was the
                    first ever matriculation school for boys started in our district (on 1st June 1964). It was a
                    beautiful Roman Catholic School. I was an obedient student. I didn't get into much trouble. Most of
                    the troubles were because of my friends. They were the naughty ones. It's just sad that I'm not in
                    touch with them anymore. I was not very good at any team sport (except cricket). This inability
                    might be one of the reasons for me picking up music, but I can never be sure!

            <p>During my undergrad, I happened to be the class representative twice (and I hated it).</p>
            <p>At PSG, I was part of a club called Radio Hub. We operated a community radio and I was a production
                assistant. We hold a

                for an event that we conducted. It was hectic but fun!

            <p>I wanted to pursue music after school, but my parents didn't allow me. In retrospect, it turned out to be
                a good thing!</p>
            <p>I was forced to study biology in high school. I still think it was a bad idea. I should've studied
                computer science!</p>
