            <h3>Work Experience</h3>
            <article>
                <p>
                    <strong>Company:</strong> Fidelity Investments <br>
                    <strong>Role:</strong> Associate Software Engineer <br>
                    <strong>Location:</strong> Chennai, India <br>
                    <em>November 2022 - October 2023</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Worked primarily on building the backend (using Spring Boot) of a middleware application (ETL).
                    The application would receive a webhook via the exposed apis from third-party vendors.
                    We then pull some data from the vendor's exposed apis and process them.
                    Finally, we send the processed data to a downstream system which eventually reaches the mainframe
                    server.

                    Other than this, I got to work on a few DevOps automation where I had to build CI/CD pipelines for
                    the
                    application, minimal frontend stuff using Angular and a few BU level projects to enhance the
                    development
                    experience.

                    One important project was to build a search engine that would look through the Service Now,
                    Confluence,
                    Jira and GitHub's databases and return results of the projects, tech stacks used, product owner,
                    lead
                    developer, etc.
                    The idea was to help people (in this huge organization) find similar projects, technologies or
                    whatever
                    they are looking for, so that they can get some assistance and even find platforms on which they can
                    onboard to.
                    We used Angular for the frontend and Python with Flask for the backend. I left the organization
                    before I
                    had completed it.<br>

                    This was my first ever full-time job. We were put in a training program called LEAP.
                    It is Fidelity's flagship 18-week program for recent college grads.
                    We went through an intense training on skills and technologies required to be a Full Stack Engineer.
                    We primarily learnt Angular and Spring Boot along with some soft skills.
                    The capstone project was to build a trading platform with authentication and apis using Angular for
                    the
                    frontend and Spring Boot for the backend.

                    Other than that, I collaborated with my previous manager's team to build a chatbot that can aid the
                    tenants of our platform.
                    The platform hosts an application called Adeptia.
                    It is a low code platform that other teams in the organization can make use of for their usecases.

                    This internship was during the final semester of college.
                    It was quite tough to manage both our college project and the internship.
                    But I somehow got through it (like any other situation in life).
                    I was a part of the core team that maintained an application platform called Adeptia.
                    The application was going through a major upgrade.
                    They had recently moved from a monolith architecture to microservices architecture.
                    I worked on testing the newer version to see if the application scaled properly, to see if the
                    performance was adequate and to find other bugs.
                    This would then be reported to the vendor (Adeptia was a third-party vendor application).
                    I then worked on building a Work Intake Tool.
                    This tool would collect some data from potential tenants of the platform to see if their usecase
                    would
                    fit.
                    We used a survey tool called Qualtrics with some custom Javascript code and Microsoft's Power
                    Automate.

                    This internship was during my third year in college.
                    This was a 2-month internship that happened during the summer break.
                    I was part of an Enterprise Data Lake team, which primarily used Snowflake as their data warehouse (Fidelity was amid a major migration from Mainframe to Cloud).
                    I worked on the development of an automation framework using Python, SQL and Pytest for an ETL process.
                    This helped reduce the testing time significantly.
                    I got exposed to agile framework here.
                    I gained a fair understanding on how a finance firm's back office operates.
